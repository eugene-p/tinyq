# @qkitt/tinyq-bench

Benchmarks for [`@qkitt/tinyq`](../queue).

Compares in-process bare-queue and worker-drain performance against similar libraries. Runs locally and in CI from the monorepo root. Published summary numbers live in the [root README](../../README.md#benchmarks) and the [queue package README](../queue/README.md#benchmark-summary) — re-run from here after changing the core.

## Peers

`@qkitt/tinyq` is two layers: a bare queue (`buildQueue`) and an optional concurrent drain (`withWorker`). Each suite picks peers that actually do the same job as the layer being tested.

| Suite | Libraries | Role of peers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bare queue | `@qkitt/tinyq` (`buildQueue`), [denque](https://github.com/invertase/denque), [yocto-queue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/yocto-queue), native `Array` | Pure enqueue/dequeue structures — no worker API |
| Worker drain | `@qkitt/tinyq` (`withWorker`), [fastq](https://github.com/mcollina/fastq), [p-queue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-queue), [async.queue](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/docs.html#queue) | In-process concurrent job runners |

## Run

From the monorepo root (after `npm install`):

```bash
npm run bench
npm run bench:fifo
npm run bench:worker
```

Or from this package:

```bash
npm run bench -w @qkitt/tinyq-bench
```

Build `@qkitt/tinyq` first if dist is missing:

```bash
npm run build:tinyq
npm run bench
```

## Fairness

**Metrics:** `ops/s` is median operations per second across benchmark runs. `heap Δ` is the retained `heapUsed` delta while all items are held (full queue; worker paused or not started).

- Same job body (sync no-op) and job counts across libraries
- Warmup via `tinybench`
- Worker suite measures end-to-end drain (enqueue + process until **N jobs finished**)
- `@qkitt/tinyq` completion is a **job counter inside the worker fn** (same idea as `Promise.all` / task callbacks on peers), not `worker:idle` — so the bench does not depend on the event path for correctness
- Worker matrix (**4 cells**): jobs **1k / 10k** × concurrency **1 / 4** (`WORKER_JOB_COUNTS`, `WORKER_CONCURRENCIES` in `src/helpers.ts`)
- **Memory**: retained `heapUsed` / `rss` while all N items are still held (full queue; worker with pump paused / not started). Scripts use `--expose-gc` for cleaner deltas.
- Results vary by machine/Node version; treat as relative, not absolute claims

## Layout

```
src/
  index.ts       # CLI entry (all | fifo | worker)
  fifo.ts        # Bare enqueue/dequeue + retained memory
  worker.ts      # Concurrent worker drain + pending-job memory
  memory.ts      # heap/rss helpers
  helpers.ts     # Shared constants / formatting
```
